Delphi Free Stuff Package


Description:
  All components from the Delphi Free Stuff web site (www.delphifreestuff.com).
  See the individual text files for a description of each component.


Contact Information:
  The lateset version will always be available on the web at:
    http://www.delphifreestuff.com
  If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please use the Delphi
  Free Stuff Support Forum at: 
    http://www.delphifreestuff.com/discus/
  If, for some reason, you can not use the web-based support forum, you can
  email me at bstowers@delphifreestuff.com.  However, the support forum will
  always take precedence over direct email since it provides a resource that
  others can use when they have a problem.  Every message posted to the forum
  is emailed directly to this account, so emailing me directly will not get 
  your message to me any faster.  It will only make the message less important
  for me to respond to since only one person (you) is benefiting from it
  instead of everyone interested.  Having said all that, please do email me 
  directly if it is regarding something that isn't really support related, 
  i.e. just to say thanks (as novel as that idea is).

      files), click the Compile button instead.


Notes:
  * There are no demos included in this distribution.  If you want a demo app
    for one of the components, you will need to download that individual 
    component from the web site.
  * No version history is kept for this file.  It simply contains the latest 
    version of everything.  For individual component history/release notes,
    see the individual text files.
